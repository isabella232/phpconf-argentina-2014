====================

**Points: 2**

Choose one or more endpoints from the echonest api ([http://developer.echonest.com](http://developer.echonest.com)) and create a high level wrapper, that will consume it, parse the results and possibly (if you would like to), serialize the results in other structures (like collections and entities/types). Also, create unit tests for your code.
